# Company Culture
## Creativity and Innovation
Employees at Apple are encouraged to think outside the box and then disregard that box. They do not make products or set their goals based on what competing companies are doing. Instead, this pool of professionals is expected to develop the best possible ways, not the best practices.

## Moderate Competition 
The company also encourages a moderate level of competition among teams to drive growth and improved output. Apple was more competitive under Steve Jobs, but Tim Cook has reduced the internal competition in favour of more collaboration and teamwork. This balanced level of competition allows employees to challenge their limits without causing a toxic work environment. 

## Excellence 

Furthermore, as a top-notch company, Apple only employs outstanding talents. The company's leaders â€” Steve Jobs and Tom Cook, are known for firing those who slack during their duties. This culture allows only pure excellence and willingness to work into the company's system. 

Also, it promotes excellence and Apple's general growth as an organization. The company is well-known for providing only the best products in the technology industry, especially in marketing and product design.
